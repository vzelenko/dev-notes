# Overview
## TL;DR
Welcome to my dev-notes project.  I intend this repo to keep track of all the useful and interesting bits of information for the developer to use, including environment setup, SysOp practices, technology adaptation, etc.

This will remain public, so any suggestion for improvement and additional content will be appreciated, seriously considered and incorporated at the earliest convenience.
